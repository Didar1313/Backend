## ðŸ§  Why Do We Need REST API Versioning?

Imagine this real situation in your **Spring Boot blog project**:

---

### ðŸ§± You Launch API v1:

```http
GET /api/v1/posts
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "Spring Boot Basics",
  "content": "Some content here"
}
```

Your frontend or mobile app is using this API â€” it works fine.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Later, You Add New Features in v2:

Now you want:

* Add author's name
* Format content differently
* Add comments or tags
* Rename some fields (`content` â†’ `body`)

So now the response looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "Spring Boot Basics",
  "body": "Some updated content",
  "author": "Didar",
  "tags": ["java", "spring"]
}
```

If you update your `/api/v1/posts` to return this, it will **break your frontend**, because it's expecting:

* A field called `content`
* No `author`, `tags`, etc.

---

## âœ… Versioning Solves This

You create:

* `/api/v1/posts` â†’ Still returns the old format
* `/api/v2/posts` â†’ Returns the new format with extra fields

That way:

* **Old frontend still works**
* **New frontend can use the upgraded version**
* You can **test safely** without breaking live users

---

## ðŸ”’ Think of It Like This:

> "Versioning = Promise to the client that we wonâ€™t change the structure without notice."

---

## ðŸ”„ When You Might Need to Version

* Adding/removing/changing fields in JSON
* Changing data format (e.g., text â†’ markdown)
* Renaming endpoints (`/blogs` â†’ `/posts`)
* Changing business logic (e.g., filtering, sorting rules)
* Supporting mobile apps and web apps with different needs

---

## ðŸ’¬ Simple Analogy:

Your API is like a public bus route:

* People rely on the stops (fields, structure)
* If you suddenly change the route without notice, people get lost
* Instead, you open a **new route (v2)** so old passengers are safe and new passengers get the improvements

## ðŸ§  Why Use Custom Header Versioning in REST APIs?

Imagine this real situation in your **Spring Boot blog project**:

---

### ðŸ§± You Launch API with Default Version:

Your clients call:

```http
GET /posts
```

Without any version info in the URL or parameters.

The server returns:

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "Spring Boot Basics",
  "content": "Some content here"
}
```

Your frontend or mobile app uses this data and works fine.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Later, You Add New Features in a New API Version:

You want to add:

* Author's name
* Format content differently
* Add comments or tags
* Rename some fields (`content` â†’ `body`)

Now the new response looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "Spring Boot Basics",
  "body": "Some updated content",
  "author": "Didar",
  "tags": ["java", "spring"]
}
```

### ðŸ”‘ How Clients Request Specific Versions Using Headers

To keep old clients working and allow new clients to get new data, clients send a **custom header** like:

```
API-Version: 1
```

or

```
API-Version: 2
```

---

### âœ… Server Behavior

* If the client sends `API-Version: 1`, server responds with old format (no author, no tags, `content` field).
* If the client sends `API-Version: 2`, server responds with new format (includes author, tags, `body` field).
* If no version header is sent, server defaults to version 1 (for backward compatibility).

---

### ðŸ”’ Think of It Like This:

> "Custom header versioning is like telling the server which bus route you want to take â€” the old one or the new improved one â€” without changing the bus stop address (URL)."

---

### ðŸ”„ When You Might Use Custom Header Versioning

* You want to keep URLs clean and simple
* You want clients to explicitly tell which API version to use
* You control clients and can make sure they send headers properly
* You want to avoid breaking old clients while improving API

---

### ðŸ§° Simple Example in Spring Boot:

```java
@GetMapping("/posts")
public ResponseEntity<?> getPosts(@RequestHeader(value = "API-Version", required = false) String apiVersion) {
    if ("2".equals(apiVersion)) {
        // return new format with author, tags, body
    } else {
        // return old format with content field only
    }
}
```
