### ‚úÖ **Phase 2: SQL Mastery (Hero Level - Part 1)**

> üéØ Goal: Learn how to write powerful, real-world SQL queries to interact with data.

---

## üîπ 1. **Filtering & Sorting**

These two are used together often in real-world queries to pull the exact data you need.

---

### ‚úÖ `WHERE` ‚Äì Filter rows based on condition

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE name = 'Didar';
```

‚û°Ô∏è Fetches only the rows where the name is **Didar**.

You can use operators:

* `=` (equal)
* `!=` or `<>` (not equal)
* `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
* `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `IS NULL`

üß† Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE id > 5;

SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE email LIKE '%gmail.com';

SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE id IN (1, 3, 5);
```

---

### ‚úÖ `ORDER BY` ‚Äì Sort the result

Sorts data **ascending (`ASC`)** or **descending (`DESC`)**.

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
ORDER BY name ASC;

SELECT * FROM Users
ORDER BY id DESC;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Combine `WHERE` + `ORDER BY`

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE name LIKE 'D%'
ORDER BY id DESC;
```
---

## üîπ **Special Characters in SQL (Used in `WHERE` Clause)**

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **`%`** ‚Äì Wildcard for any number of characters

Used with `LIKE` to match patterns.

| Pattern  | Meaning                | Example Match        |
| -------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| `'D%'`   | Starts with D          | Didar, Daniel        |
| `'%r'`   | Ends with r            | Didar, Asher         |
| `'%id%'` | Contains "id" anywhere | Didar, Midori, David |

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE name LIKE 'D%';
```

‚û°Ô∏è Finds all names **starting with "D"**

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **`_` (underscore)** ‚Äì Wildcard for **one single character**

| Pattern   | Meaning                        | Matches      |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `'D_dar'` | D, any single char, then "dar" | Didar, Dodar |

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE name LIKE 'D_dar';
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **`IN`** ‚Äì Matches one of multiple values

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```

‚û°Ô∏è Equivalent to: `id = 1 OR id = 2 OR id = 3`

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **`BETWEEN`** ‚Äì Matches values in a **range (inclusive)**

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

‚û°Ô∏è Gets all orders in the year 2024

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **`IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`** ‚Äì Check if value is missing

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE email IS NULL;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Finds users **without an email**

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **`<>` or `!=`** ‚Äì Not equal

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE name <> 'Didar';
```

---

Great! Let's dive into the next topic of **Phase 2**:

---

## üîπ **2. Aggregations ‚Äì COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING**

> üéØ Goal: Learn how to summarize and analyze your data.

---

### ‚úÖ **Aggregate Functions**

---

### üî∏ `COUNT()` ‚Äì Count number of rows

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Counts **all users**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(email) FROM Users;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Counts only users **who have an email** (ignores NULLs)

---

### üî∏ `SUM()` ‚Äì Total value of a column

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT SUM(price) FROM Orders;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Calculates the **total price** of all orders

---

### üî∏ `AVG()` ‚Äì Average value

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT AVG(price) FROM Orders;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Calculates the **average order price**

---

### üî∏ `MAX()` and `MIN()` ‚Äì Highest and lowest values

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT MAX(price), MIN(price) FROM Orders;
```

---

## üîπ **GROUP BY** ‚Äì Group rows and apply aggregation **to each group**

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY user_id;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Counts how many orders **each user** has made.

---

### üî∏ `GROUP BY` with `SUM()`:

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(price) AS total_sales
FROM Products
GROUP BY category;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Total sales per product category

---

## üîπ **HAVING** ‚Äì Filter groups (used **after** `GROUP BY`)

üß† Example:

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING total_orders > 5;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Shows only users with **more than 5 orders**

üîë Use `HAVING` for **group filters**
üîë Use `WHERE` for **row filters**

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Function        | Use                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `COUNT()`       | Number of rows                  |
| `SUM()`         | Total value                     |
| `AVG()`         | Average value                   |
| `MAX()`/`MIN()` | Largest/Smallest value          |
| `GROUP BY`      | Group rows by a column          |
| `HAVING`        | Filter groups after aggregation |
