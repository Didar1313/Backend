## ✅ **Phase 1: Fundamentals (Zero Level)**

### 🔹 **1. What is a Database?**

A **database** is simply a place to store data in an organized way so it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

🧠 **Example:**
Think of a **spreadsheet** with rows and columns. You can add data, look it up, and update it. A database works similarly, but it's **more powerful**, **faster**, and **secure**.

🛠️ **Real-life Use Cases:**

* Storing user info in a website (name, email, password)
* Saving order details in an eCommerce app
* Keeping track of students in a school system

---

### 🔹 **2. Relational Database vs Non-Relational**

#### 🧩 **Relational Database (RDBMS)**

* Stores data in **tables** (like Excel sheets)
* Each table has **rows** and **columns**
* Tables are connected using **relationships** (like Foreign Keys)
* Uses **SQL** (Structured Query Language) to manage data

🧠 **Example:**
A table for `Users` and another for `Orders`, where each order has a `user_id` pointing to a specific user.

✅ Popular RDBMS:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Oracle
* SQL Server

---

#### 🧩 **Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)**

* Stores data in **flexible formats** (JSON, key-value, documents, graphs)
* Good for **unstructured or semi-structured** data
* Doesn’t require fixed schemas
* No strict relationships between data

🧠 **Example:**
MongoDB stores data like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Didar",
  "email": "didar@example.com",
  "orders": [
    { "id": 1, "item": "Phone" },
    { "id": 2, "item": "Watch" }
  ]
}
```

✅ Popular NoSQL Databases:

* MongoDB
* Firebase Realtime / Firestore
* Redis

### ⚔️ **Relational vs Non-Relational – When to Use What?**

| Feature        | Relational DB           | Non-Relational DB           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Schema         | Fixed                   | Flexible                    |
| Relationships  | Strong (via joins)      | Weak (often embedded)       |
| Data Structure | Tables                  | Documents, key-values, etc. |
| Use Case       | Banking, eCommerce, ERP | Chat apps, IoT, Analytics   |

### 🔹 **3. Basic Terminology**

Understanding these core terms will help you a lot when we start writing queries and designing databases.

---

#### ✅ **a. Table**

A **table** is like an Excel sheet. It holds data in rows and columns.

🧠 Example: A `Users` table

| id | name  | email                                     |
| -- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Didar | [didar@gmail.com](mailto:didar@gmail.com) |
| 2  | Lina  | [lina@gmail.com](mailto:omar@gmail.com)   |

---

#### ✅ **b. Row**

Each **row** is a single record (or entry) in a table.

➡️ A row in `Users` table might represent one user:

```text
(1, 'Didar', 'didar@gmail.com')
```

---

#### ✅ **c. Column**

Each **column** represents a field/attribute (like name, age, etc.)

➡️ In the `Users` table:

* `name` column holds user names
* `email` column holds user emails

---

#### ✅ **d. Primary Key**

A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each row in a table.
It must be **unique** and **not null**.

➡️ Example: `id` in the `Users` table

---

#### ✅ **e. Foreign Key**

A **Foreign Key** links one table to another.

➡️ Example: In an `Orders` table:

| order\_id | user\_id | product |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| 101       | 1        | Phone   |
| 102       | 2        | Watch   |

Here, `user_id` is a **foreign key** referring to the `id` in the `Users` table.

---

#### ✅ **f. Schema**

A **schema** is the structure of your database: tables, columns, data types, and relationships.

---

#### ✅ **g. Relationships**

In relational databases, **relationships** define how data in one table connects to data in another. There are 3 main types:

---

#### 🔁 **One-to-One (1:1)**

One record in Table A is linked to **only one** record in Table B.

🧠 Example:
Each person has **one passport**

* `Person(id)` ↔ `Passport(person_id)`

---

#### 🔁 **One-to-Many (1\:N)**

One record in Table A is linked to **many** records in Table B.

🧠 Example:
One **user** can have **many orders**

* `Users(id)` → `Orders(user_id)`

This is the **most common** relationship.

---

#### 🔁 **Many-to-Many (N\:M)**

Records in Table A can relate to **many** in Table B and vice versa.

🧠 Example:
A **student** can enroll in **many courses**, and each **course** has **many students**.

➡️ We need a **junction table** like `StudentCourse(student_id, course_id)` to handle this.

---

### ✅ Summary of Basic Terms:

| Term          | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Table         | Structure to store data (like Excel sheet) |
| Row           | A single record (e.g., a user)             |
| Column        | A field or attribute (e.g., name, email)   |
| Primary Key   | Uniquely identifies a row                  |
| Foreign Key   | Connects to another table                  |
| Schema        | Blueprint of the database                  |
| Relationships | How tables are connected (1:1, 1\:N, N\:M) |

### ✅ **4. Introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language)**

> SQL is the language used to communicate with **relational databases**.

We’ll learn 4 basic SQL commands to **Create, Read, Update, Delete** data – also known as **CRUD**.

---

#### 🔹 **1. `SELECT` – Read Data**

Used to fetch data from a table.

🧠 Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users;
```

➡️ Returns all rows and columns from the `Users` table.

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM Users;
```

➡️ Returns only the `name` and `email` columns.

---

#### 🔹 **2. `INSERT` – Add Data**

Used to insert a new row into a table.

🧠 Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO Users (name, email)
VALUES ('Didar', 'didar@gmail.com');
```

---

#### 🔹 **3. `UPDATE` – Modify Data**

Used to update existing data.

🧠 Example:

```sql
UPDATE Users
SET name = 'Md. Didar'
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

#### 🔹 **4. `DELETE` – Remove Data**

Used to delete data from a table.

🧠 Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE id = 2;
```

---

### ✅ Summary of Basic SQL Commands:

| Command | Action      | Example                          |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| SELECT  | Read data   | `SELECT * FROM Users;`           |
| INSERT  | Add data    | `INSERT INTO Users (...) VALUES` |
| UPDATE  | Modify data | `UPDATE Users SET ... WHERE ...` |
| DELETE  | Remove data | `DELETE FROM Users WHERE ...`    |
