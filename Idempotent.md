### üîç What Does "Idempotent" Mean?

**Idempotent** is a fancy word from mathematics and computer science. In simple terms:

> An operation is **idempotent** if doing it once has the same effect as doing it multiple times.

---

### üöÄ In REST API Terms:

Some HTTP methods are **idempotent**, which means:

> If you call the same API with the same input **multiple times**, it should have **the same effect** as calling it once.

### ‚úÖ Idempotent HTTP Methods:

| Method     | Example                               | Is it Idempotent? | Why?                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**    | `/users/1`                            | ‚úÖ Yes             | Fetching data doesn‚Äôt change it.                                                        |
| **PUT**    | `/users/1` with data `{name: "John"}` | ‚úÖ Yes             | Updating with the same data again and again doesn‚Äôt change the result.                  |
| **DELETE** | `/users/1`                            | ‚úÖ Yes (ideally)   | Deleting the same user repeatedly still results in "user not found" after first delete. |
| **HEAD**   | `/users/1`                            | ‚úÖ Yes             | Like GET but only checks headers.                                                       |

### ‚ùå Non-idempotent Methods:

| Method   | Example                             | Is it Idempotent? | Why Not?                                                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **POST** | `/users` with data `{name: "John"}` | ‚ùå No              | Each call creates a new user ‚Äì so it changes the system every time. |

---

### üí° Real-World Analogy:

* **PUT**: Like setting a light switch to "ON". No matter how many times you flip it to "ON", the result is the same ‚Äì the light is on. (‚úÖ Idempotent)
* **POST**: Like adding a new book to a shelf. Every time you do it, the number of books increases. (‚ùå Not idempotent)

---

### ‚úÖ Why It Matters

* Helps with **retries**: If a network fails and your app retries, you want to avoid duplicate actions.
* Makes APIs **more reliable** and **predictable**.
