# What is a Domain Name?

A **domain name** is the **human-friendly name** of a website that you type in your browser to visit it.

Examples:
- `google.com`
- `facebook.com`
- `youtube.com`

These names are easier to remember than long numbers called **IP addresses**.

## 🔢 Behind the Scenes: IP Address

Every website lives on a server with an **IP address** (like `142.250.190.4`), which is how computers find each other on the internet.

But since it's hard for humans to remember numbers, we use **domain names** instead.

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** converts those domain names into IP addresses.  
It's like your phone's contact list: you see the name “Mom” and the phone calls the number behind the scenes.

## 🧱 Structure of a Domain Name

Let’s break down:  
`www.example.com`

- `www` → Subdomain (optional)
- `example` → 2nd Level Domain 
- `.com` → Top-Level Domain (TLD)


## 🌐 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. You type `www.google.com` in your browser
2. The browser asks a **DNS server**: “What’s the IP for google.com?”
3. DNS replies with something like `142.250.190.4`
4. Your browser uses that IP to visit Google's server
5. Website loads!

## ✅ Summary

| Term             | Meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| **Domain Name**  | Human-readable address of a website |
| **IP Address**   | Numeric address of a server |
| **DNS**          | Translates domain names to IP addresses |

So, instead of typing `142.250.190.4`, you simply type `google.com` — thanks to **domain names**!
