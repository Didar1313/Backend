# How Does the Internet Work?

The internet works like a **huge delivery system** that sends and receives information between devices all over the world.

Let’s break it down in simple steps:

---

## 1. You Type a Website Address (URL)

Example:  
You type `www.google.com` into your browser.

---

## 2. Your Request Goes to a Server

Your computer doesn't know where Google is, so it asks a special computer called a **DNS server** (like a phonebook) to find the IP address of `www.google.com`.

It might return something like:  
`142.250.190.4` ← This is Google's real address on the internet.

---

## 3. Your Device Connects to the Server

Now that it has the IP address, your computer sends a request to Google's server (like saying: “Hey Google, show me your homepage!”).

---

## 4. Data Travels Through Networks

The request travels through:
- Your Wi-Fi or mobile network
- Your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
- Long cables under the ocean, satellites, and data centers
- Eventually reaching Google’s server

---

## 5. Server Sends Data Back to You

Google’s server sends back the web page as small data packets (like little puzzle pieces).

---

## 6. Your Browser Rebuilds the Webpage

Your browser (like Chrome or Safari) receives all the packets, puts them together, and shows you the page.

---

## 🌐 Quick Analogy:

- You → Type a website
- DNS → Finds the address
- Your request → Travels through networks
- Server → Replies with data
- Your browser → Displays the page

---

## ✅ Summary:

The internet works by sending data between your device and other computers (servers) across the world using a combination of:
- IP addresses
- DNS servers
- Internet service providers
- Cables and routers

All this happens in **seconds**—that’s the power of the internet!
