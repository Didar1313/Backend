# What is HTTP?

**HTTP** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**.  
It is the **language** your browser uses to communicate with web servers and request web pages or data.

## üí¨ How HTTP Works

1. You type a website URL like `http://example.com`
2. Your browser sends an **HTTP request** to that server
3. The server replies with an **HTTP response**
4. Your browser shows the content

## üìë Common HTTP Methods

- `GET`: Ask for a page or data  
- `POST`: Send data (like a form)  
- `PUT`: Update something  
- `DELETE`: Remove something

---

## üîê What is HTTPS?

- **HTTPS** is the secure version of HTTP
- The "S" means **Secure** ‚Äì data is encrypted
- Always prefer `https://` websites

## üîÑ HTTP Connections: Two Types

### 1. **Non-persistent HTTP**

- A **new TCP connection** is opened for **each object**
- Only **one object** is sent per connection
- Then the connection is **closed**
- To load a full web page (HTML + images + CSS...), the browser needs **multiple connections**

#### ‚ùå Issues:
- Requires **2 RTTs (Round Trip Times)** per object
- **Operating System (OS)** overhead from repeatedly opening/closing connections
- Browsers often open **multiple parallel connections** to speed things up

---

### 2. **Persistent HTTP** (Introduced in HTTP/1.1)

- **One TCP connection** stays **open** between client and server
- Multiple objects can be sent over this **single connection**
- Browser sends more requests as it finds them, without waiting

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:
- Connection remains open after initial response
- Client can fetch all page elements **faster**
- Requires **only 1 RTT** for all objects
- **Reduces delay** and saves resources

## üåê Summary Table

| Feature                | Non-Persistent HTTP      | Persistent HTTP          |
|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| TCP Connections        | New for each object      | One reused connection     |
| Speed                  | Slower                   | Faster                    |
| RTT per object         | 2                        | 1 (total)                 |
| Overhead               | High                     | Low                       |
| Standard in            | HTTP/1.0                 | HTTP/1.1 and later        |

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

HTTP is the protocol that powers almost everything you see online.  
Persistent connections (especially with HTTPS) make the internet **faster**, **safer**, and more **efficient**.
