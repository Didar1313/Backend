# What is DNS?

**DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**.  
It works like the **phonebook of the internet**.

You remember **names** (like `google.com`), but computers talk in **IP addresses** (like `142.250.190.4`).  
DNS helps **translate domain names** into IP addresses so your browser can load websites.

## 📞 Real-Life Example

Let’s say you want to call your friend “Rahim”.  
You don’t remember his number, but your phone contacts list does.

Similarly:
- You type `facebook.com`
- DNS finds the **IP address** for Facebook's server
- Your browser connects to that IP and shows the website

## 🔄 How DNS Works (Step-by-Step)

Let’s say you visit: `www.example.com`

1. **Browser Checks Cache**  
   It checks if it already knows the IP of `example.com` from a recent visit.

2. **Ask DNS Resolver (ISP)**  
   If not found, it asks your **ISP's DNS resolver** (like Grameenphone, BTCL, etc.).

3. **Ask Root DNS Server**  
   If resolver doesn’t know, it asks a **Root Server**:  
   “Where is `.com`?”

4. **Ask TLD Server**  
   The root server replies: “Ask the **.com** TLD server.”

5. **Ask Authoritative DNS Server**  
   TLD server replies: “Ask the server responsible for `example.com`.”

6. **Get IP Address**  
   The final DNS server replies: "`example.com` = `93.184.216.34`"

7. **Browser Connects to Server**  
   Now the browser visits that IP and loads the site.

## 🗺️ DNS Hierarchy (like a map)

```plaintext
Root Server
   ↓
Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server — like .com, .org, .bd
   ↓
Authoritative DNS Server — stores exact IP of the domain
```

## 🧠 Quick Terms

| Term                 | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|
| **DNS**              | Domain Name System — translates names to IPs |
| **IP Address**       | Numeric address of a website |
| **DNS Resolver**     | First helper — usually from your ISP |
| **Root Server**      | Knows where TLD servers are |
| **TLD Server**       | Knows where `.com`, `.org`, `.bd` domains are |
| **Authoritative Server** | Knows the real IP of the domain |

## ⚡ Does DNS Slow You Down?

Not really!  
Most DNS results are **cached (stored)** to make future lookups **super fast**.

## ✅ Summary

- DNS helps browsers find websites by turning names into IPs
- It uses a step-by-step search system across DNS servers
- Without DNS, you'd have to **memorize IP addresses** (😫)
