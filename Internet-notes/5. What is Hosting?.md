# What is Hosting?

**Hosting** (or **Web Hosting**) is the service that stores your website’s files and makes them available on the **internet**.

When you create a website, it’s made up of files like:
- HTML (structure)
- CSS (design)
- Images
- Code (JavaScript, PHP, etc.)

To make your website visible to others, those files need to be **stored on a computer that’s always connected to the internet**.  
That computer is called a **server** — and the company that provides it is called a **hosting provider**.

## 🏠 A Real-Life Example

Think of your website as a **shop**.

- The **domain name** is your shop’s **address** (like `myshop.com`)
- The **hosting** is the **land/building** where your shop sits
- The **files and content** are the **products** inside

Without hosting, your website can’t be seen — it would be like a shop with no location!
