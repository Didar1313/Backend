# What is a Web Browser?

A **web browser** is a software (app) that lets you **visit websites** on the internet.

You use a browser to type a website name (like `youtube.com`) and it loads the page for you.

## ðŸ§  What Does a Browser Do?

A browser's main job is to:

1. Take your input (e.g. `www.facebook.com`)
2. Find the **IP address** using DNS
3. Connect to the **web server**
4. Get the **websiteâ€™s files** (HTML, CSS, images, etc.)
5. **Display** the website on your screen

## ðŸ”„ Step-by-Step: How Browsers Work

Letâ€™s say you open your browser and type `www.google.com`. Hereâ€™s what happens:

### 1. **You Enter a URL**
You type a web address (like `www.google.com`) into the address bar.

### 2. **DNS Lookup**
The browser uses **DNS** to find the IP address of Googleâ€™s server.

### 3. **Establish Connection**
It makes a **TCP connection** with the server using a protocol like **HTTP or HTTPS**.

### 4. **Send Request**
The browser sends a request:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
```

### 5. **Receive Response**
The server sends back the files for the web page (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

### 6. **Render the Page**
The browser reads the code and displays the webpage on your screen.

Rendering = **Turning code into visuals**

The browser reads HTML â†’ builds the structure of the page  
Reads CSS â†’ applies styles (color, layout, fonts)  
Reads JavaScript â†’ adds interactivity (sliders, animations, etc.)
