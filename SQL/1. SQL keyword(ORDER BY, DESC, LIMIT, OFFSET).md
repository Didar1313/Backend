`ORDER BY`, `DESC`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET` 

| id | name    | salary |
|----|---------|--------|
| 1  | Alice   | 50000  |
| 2  | Bob     | 60000  |
| 3  | Charlie | 45000  |
| 4  | David   | 70000  |
| 5  | Eve     | 55000  |

**1. `ORDER BY`:**

* **What it does:** The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the rows in your result set based on one or more columns.
* **How it works:** You specify the column(s) you want to sort by after the `ORDER BY` keyword.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM Employees
   ORDER BY salary;
   ```

   This query would return all the employees, but this time they would be sorted by their `salary` in ascending order (from lowest to highest):

   | id | name    | salary |
   |----|---------|--------|
   | 3  | Charlie | 45000  |
   | 1  | Alice   | 50000  |
   | 5  | Eve     | 55000  |
   | 2  | Bob     | 60000  |
   | 4  | David   | 70000  |

**2. `DESC` (Descending):**

* **What it does:** `DESC` is an optional keyword that you can use with `ORDER BY`. It stands for "descending".
* **How it works:** If you want to sort the results from highest to lowest, you add `DESC` after the column name in the `ORDER BY` clause.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM Employees
   ORDER BY salary DESC;
   ```

   This query would sort the employees by `salary` in descending order (from highest to lowest):

   | id | name    | salary |
   |----|---------|--------|
   | 4  | David   | 70000  |
   | 2  | Bob     | 60000  |
   | 5  | Eve     | 55000  |
   | 1  | Alice   | 50000  |
   | 3  | Charlie | 45000  |

**3. `LIMIT`:**

* **What it does:** The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by the query.
* **How it works:** You specify the maximum number of rows you want to see after the `LIMIT` keyword.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM Employees
   ORDER BY salary DESC
   LIMIT 2;
   ```

   This query would return only the top 2 employees with the highest salaries:

   | id | name  | salary |
   |----|-------|--------|
   | 4  | David | 70000  |
   | 2  | Bob   | 60000  |

**4. `OFFSET`:**

* **What it does:** The `OFFSET` clause is used to specify the starting point for the rows returned by the query. It allows you to skip a certain number of rows before the `LIMIT` clause starts selecting.
* **How it works:** You specify the number of rows you want to skip after the `OFFSET` keyword. The counting of rows starts from 0.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM Employees
   ORDER BY salary DESC
   LIMIT 3
   OFFSET 1;
   ```

   Let's break this down:
   1. `ORDER BY salary DESC`: Sorts the employees by salary from highest to lowest (David, Bob, Eve, Alice, Charlie).
   2. `OFFSET 1`: Skips the first row (David).
   3. `LIMIT 3`: Returns the next 3 rows after the skipped one.

   The result would be:

   | id | name    | salary |
   |----|---------|--------|
   | 2  | Bob     | 60000  |
   | 5  | Eve     | 55000  |
   | 1  | Alice   | 50000  |

**In the context of your drag-and-drop question:**

The goal was to select the 3rd to 5th rows from the `Employees` table, ordered by salary in descending order.

1. **`ORDER BY salary DESC`**: First, you sort by salary from highest to lowest.
2. **`OFFSET 2`**: To get to the 3rd row, you need to skip the first 2 rows. Remember that the row numbering starts from 0. So, offset 2 means skip the 1st (index 0) and 2nd (index 1) rows.
3. **`LIMIT 3`**: You want to select three rows (the 3rd, 4th, and 5th).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 2
LIMIT 3;
```
