### 🧠 Part 1: What is REST?

**REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**. It is a set of rules (or architecture style) for designing **web APIs**.

Imagine you have an app that needs to get or send data from/to a server (like getting product info, saving user info, etc.). REST is a way for your app to talk to the server using **HTTP methods** like:

* **GET** – To get data
* **POST** – To send (create) new data
* **PUT** – To update existing data
* **DELETE** – To delete data

### 📦 Part 2: What is a REST API?

A **REST API** is an application programming interface that follows the REST rules. It's like a **menu** in a restaurant: you (client) pick what you want from the menu (API), and the kitchen (server) prepares it and sends it back.

For example:

* `GET /products` – Get a list of all products
* `GET /products/1` – Get the product with ID = 1
* `POST /products` – Add a new product
* `PUT /products/1` – Update product with ID = 1
* `DELETE /products/1` – Delete product with ID = 1

### 💻 Part 3: REST API in Spring Boot (Java)

Spring Boot makes it super easy to build REST APIs in Java.

```

### What’s happening:

* `@RestController`: Tells Spring this class handles REST requests.
* `@RequestMapping("/products")`: All routes start with `/products`.
* `@GetMapping`: Handles GET request.
* `@PostMapping`: Handles POST request with request body.
* `@DeleteMapping`: Deletes a product using the index from the URL.

### ⚙️ Tools You Can Use

* **Postman** or **curl**: To test your API endpoints.
* **Spring Boot DevTools**: For automatic reloads.
* **Spring Initializr**: [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) (To generate your Spring Boot project).

### 📌 Summary (Beginner-Friendly Steps):

1. **Learn basic HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
2. **Understand what an API does**: sends and receives data.
3. **Use Spring Boot annotations** like `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, etc.
4. **Test your APIs** with Postman.
5. **Gradually add database support** using JPA and MySQL or H2.
